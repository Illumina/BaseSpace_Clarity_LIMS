Welcome to the BaseSpace Clarity LIMS GitHub repository!

The aim is to have code examples and API libraries hosted centrally here.

Currently, you will find the mature **glsapiutil.py** library which should be used for production code.

You will also find **glsapiutil3.py**, which is currently a bleeding-edge alpha version of a library that works with both Python v2 and v3. It is currently lacking some error-checking code and extra functionality present in the mature library, so please use it at your own risk!
